## Problem Description  
Given an array `arr`, rotate the array by one position in the **clockwise** direction.

---

## Examples  

### Example 1:  
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  

**Output:**  
`[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`  

**Explanation:**  
If we rotate `arr` by one position in a clockwise direction, `5` comes to the front and the remaining elements are shifted to the end.  

---

### Example 2:  
**Input:**  
`arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]`  

**Output:**  
`[3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]`  

**Explanation:**  
After rotating clockwise, `3` comes to the first position.  

---

## Constraints  
- \( 1 \leq \text{arr.size()} \leq 10^5 \)  
- \( 0 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^5 \)
